**_MESOABSTRACT_**

* For this project we need an abstract class for MesoInherit to use so we create this and create two abstract methods for MesoInherit.


**_MESOINHERIT_**

* This class extends MesoAbstract so it inherits all of it's methods. I initialize some private variables to eliminate magic numbers and make my life easier.

* MesoInherit method will take in mesoStation from the driver.

* calAverage will calculate the average of the 4 elements from mesoStation and floors, ceilings, or rounds them and saves those numbers into an avgArray that is returned for later.
